# JRag
Code by Duberly Guarnizo (duberlygfr@gmail.com)
Tool to generate Resource Allocation Graphs (RAG) for the study of how operative systems work.
## Utility
This project is aimed to be used during analysis of operating systems, to demonstrate how deadlock happens, and to list the different combinations of resources and processes. It automatically determines the existence of a deadlock and creates a graph (in window and as a JPEG image to be downloaded) that can be used. This software uses Swing Java components and is to be converted to a REST API in the future.
